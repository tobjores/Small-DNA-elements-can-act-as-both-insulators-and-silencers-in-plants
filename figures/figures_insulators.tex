				\subfig{A} Known insulators were split into partially overlapping 170-bp fragments. The insulator fragments were cloned in the forward or reverse orientation between a \usename{35S}, \usename{AB80}, or \usename{Cab-1} enhancer and a 35S minimal promoter driving the expression of a barcoded GFP reporter gene. Constructs without an enhancer (none) but with insulator fragments were also created.
				\subfig{B} All insulator fragment constructs were pooled and subjected to Plant STARR-seq in \tobacco leaves (\tobacco) and \maize protoplasts (\maize). Reporter mRNA enrichment was normalized to a control construct without an enhancer or insulator (noEnh; log2 set to 0). The enrichment of a control construct without an insulator is indicated as a black dot. Violin plots represent the kernel density distribution and the box plots inside represent the median (center line), upper and lower quartiles, and 1.5$\times$ interquartile range (whiskers) for all corresponding constructs. Numbers at the bottom of each violin indicate the number of samples in each group.\nextentry

Nanoluciferase activity was measured in at least 4 plants from these lines and normalized to the activity of luciferase. The NanoLuc/Luc ratio was normalized to a control construct without an enhancer or insulator (noEnh; log2 set to 0).\nextentry

				\subfig{H} For transgenic \maize lines, a reporter gene driven by a moderate-strength constitutive promoter (ZmPro) and an upstream \usename{35S} enhancer was created and insulator fragments were inserted between the enhancer and promoter. The reporter gene cassette was inserted in the maize genome by site-directed integration and the expression of the reporter gene was measured in various tissues/developmental stages by ELISA.\nextentry
				\subfigtwo{I}{J} The activity of insulator fragments was measured in R1 leaves of transgenic \maize lines \parensubfig{I} and compared to the corresponding results from Plant STARR-seq in \maize protoplasts \parensubfig{J}.\nextentry
				\subfig{K} Correlation (Pearson's $R^2$) between the expression of all tested constructs across different tissues and developmental stages. The correlation with Plant STARR-seq results from \maize protoplasts is also shown.\nextentry
				Box plots in \plainsubfigref{B}, \plainsubfigref{D}, \parensubfig{F}, and \parensubfig{I} represent the median (center line), upper and lower quartiles (box limits), 1.5$\times$ interquartile range (whiskers), and outliers (points) for all corresponding samples from two to three independent replicates. Numbers at the bottom of each box plot indicate the number of samples in each group. The enrichment of a control construct without an insulator (noIns) is indicated as a dotted line.\nextentry
				In \plainsubfigref{C}, \plainsubfigref{E}, \plainsubfigref{G}, and \plainsubfigref{J}, the dashed line represents a linear regression line and error bars represent the 95\% confidence interval. Pearson's $R^2$, Spearman's $\rho$, and number ($n$) of constructs are indicated.

The enrichment of a control construct without an insulator is indicated as dotted line.\nextentry
				\subfig{C} A linear model was trained to predict the enrichment of stacked insulator constructs based on the activity of individual insulator fragments and their position within the construct. The correlation between the model's prediction (prediction) and experimentally determined enrichment values (measurement) is shown as a hexbin plot \parensubfig[color represents the count of points in each hexagon; ]{C}.

				Correlation between the activity of insulator fragments cloned between a 35S enhancer and a 35S minimal promoter with or without an additional \usename{AB80} or \usename{Cab-1} enhancer inserted between the insulator fragment and 35S minimal promoter. The dashed line represents a y = x line fitted through the point corresponding to a control construct without an insulator (black dot). Pearson's $R^2$, Spearman's $\rho$, and number ($n$) of constructs are indicated.
